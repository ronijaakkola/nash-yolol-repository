# Nash's YOLOL repository
YOLOL is a programming language used in a game called [Starbase](https://www.starbasegame.com/) by Frozenbyte. YOLOL is used inside the game to control spaceship devices. This repository contains YOLOL scripts made by me.

## Development
Most of the scripts in this repository were written using NOLOL, an extension of the YOLOL language. NOLOL adds features that are missing from YOLOL and then compiles into YOLOL code that can be executed in the game. To be able to edit scripts in this repository, follow this guide:
1. Get yourself familiar with [YODK](https://github.com/dbaumgarten/yodk) and install it to your computer
2. Open your terminal and browse to the folder that has the script you want to edit in it
3. Edit the script (.nolol file) with the editor of your choice
4. When you are done, run `yodk compile <file>.nolol` to compile the file into a YOLOL script
