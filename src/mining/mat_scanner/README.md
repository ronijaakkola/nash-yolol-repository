# Material Scanner
This script reads values from the material scanner device and displays them on a text panel. This script only shows the most valuable material of the scan array. The amount is shown both in kv and stack amount.

## Prerequisites
### Devices
- YOLOL chip (basic)
- YOLOL socket or rack
- Material point scanner
- Text panel 24Ã—24
- Hybrid button

### Installation
1. Install all devices to your ship. They must be connected to the same network.

## Known issues
- The material scanner often returns the same results 1-3 times after the beam hits something else. This seems to be a bug in the game.
