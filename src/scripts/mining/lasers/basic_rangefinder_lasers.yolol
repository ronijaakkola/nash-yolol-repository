// Points two mining laser turrets to a point where the rangefinder hits an element
// Values xo and yo are lasers' offsets from the rangefinder. X towards
// the sides of the ship and Y towards the roof of the ship. This script
// assumes that the lasers and the rangefider are on the same Z axis plane.

// This script uses an arctan approximation and it can be run on a basic
// chip. The approximation is the following: Ï€/2-OFFSET/RANGE. The end
// result is in radians and it is converted to degrees.
